# Vocabulary for Plato’s *Meno*

## What’s here?

The [LaTeX source files][source] and a [pdf download][download] for a complete vocabulary of Plato’s *Meno*.

The vocabulary covers every word in the *Meno*, no matter how basic. But to help students focus their efforts, especially common or important words have an asterisk at the start of the entry. (Common words are based on the excellent [Dickinson College Commentaries Greek core list][dccgreek]. For more details, see the introduction to the vocabulary itself.)

## How did you make this?

Time. A lot of time.

Somewhat more seriously, I derived the original list of words in the *Meno* from the [Perseus Digital Library][perseus]. I then used [Hodoi Elektronikai][hodoi] and the OCT of Plato to double check references. For meanings, principal parts, and forms in general, I used *A Greek-English Lexicon* and *An Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon* by Liddell and Scott, and *The Brill Dictionary of Ancient Greek* by Franco Montanari. (For full bibliographical details, please see the file `vocabulary.bib`.)
