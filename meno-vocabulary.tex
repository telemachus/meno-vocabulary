% [[- Introduction
This document provides a complete vocabulary for Plato's \textit{Meno}. Here's a brief description of the principles I followed in putting together the vocabulary as well as some important conventions to note.

The list should include every word in Plato's \textit{Meno}, no matter how basic, but I have flagged the more common or important words. If an asterisk appears in the outer left margin of a word, that word is either (i) especially common in ancient Greek or (ii) particularly important for Plato. In order to determine what words are especially common in ancient Greek, I relied on the ``Greek Core Vocabulary'' from the Dickinson College Commentary website.\footcite{cfrancese2014} Chrisopher Francese, the primary compiler of that list, notes that those 500 words represent nearly 65\% of all the forms in typical ancient Greek texts.\footcite{cfrancese2013} Any word in the DCC Greek List will have an asterisk, but I've also placed asterisks on some additional words. These aditional words fall into one of two categories: (i) cognates of words already on the DCC list or (ii) words I feel are especially common in or important for Plato. Words with an asterisk are a great first place for students to direct their attention when learning new vocabulary.

I relied on three sources for the content of the entries. I use both the intermediate and the large Liddell and Scott Greek lexicons\footcite{middleliddell,greatscott} as well as the more recent Brill Dictionary of Ancient Greek.\footcite{montanari2015} Within entries, commas separate synonymous meanings, and semicolons separate distinct meanings.

I've been somewhat inconsistent about principal parts. If a verb has an asterisk, I always give all its principal parts. In other cases, I've given complete principal parts if it seemed helpful—particularly if the principal parts were especially irregular or hard to predict.
